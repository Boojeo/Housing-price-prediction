# üè† Housing Price Prediction (from Scratch with One Variable)

This project demonstrates how to implement linear regression from scratch using only one feature (area) to predict housing prices.
Instead of relying on machine learning libraries like scikit-learn for training, we manually implement gradient descent, cost computation, and prediction to understand the fundamentals of regression.

## Project Overview
  
  - Dataset: Housing.csv (with at least two olumns: area and price)
  
  Input Feature: Area of the house
  
  Target: Price of the house
  
  Approach:
  
  Normalize the data
  
  Implement cost function (MSE)
  
  Implement gradient computation
  
  Perform gradient descent optimization
  
  Train the model and evaluate cost
  
  Visualize training progress and predictions
